    <div class="box">I'm John Angelo Tarroza, I live at 25 Molave St. Las Pinas City. My birthday is on October 15, 2003, my father is Self Employed while my mother is a Housewife. Throughout ny whole life i've only attended public schools such as Pilar Village Elementary School, Las Pinas National High School ALmanza, Las Pinas City National Senior High School Dona Joseefa Campus and Lastly, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa. My expectation to this subject is by the end of the semester I will be able to know all the essential knowledge and information needed to know all about database, and to be able to create and manage my own database. 5 years from now I hope I used the knowledge that I learned here to be able to maximize my skills in managing and creating database in backend development and to be a successful backend developer.
